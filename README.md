Module 1 Challenge Submission - Code Refactor


## Description

The Horiseon website about search engine optimization, reputation management, and social media marketing.

## Motivation

This project was completed to understand how to use semantic tags in HTML and how to review and improve CSS styling. By utilizing semantic tags over non-semantic tags the developer is able to provide insight on the meaning of each element to the browser and to other developers viewing the code. It provides a better glimpse at the bone structure of the webpages layout. Condensing the CSS makes the styling easier to follow and decreases the file size which in turn reduces the amount of information needed to be processed to view the desired webpage. This challenge provided insight on the importance of simplifying code as much as possible to have a website perform efficiently.

## Usage

This project can be used to review semantic HTML tags and attributes. It can also be used to review how to condense css code while maintaining the original look of a webpage.

To utilize, open webpage.
